# WordPress Foundation 6 Starter Template


## Includes
	
	* Fancybox
	* Some Editor schortcodes


## Use
  
Before you start you have to update Foundation with:

```bash
npm install
bower install
```

Finally, run 
```bash
npm start
```
to run the Sass compiler. It will re-run every time you save a Sass file.


## Upgrading

If you'd like to upgrade to a newer version of Foundation down the road just run:


```bash
bower update
```
